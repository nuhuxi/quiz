					<h3>What guitar is that?</h3>
					<div>
						<p>In the past 100 years, the guitar has risen from an acoustic rhythm instrument to a cultural icon.
						No one played "air clarinet" in the Big Band Era but modern "air guitar" competitions attract a global audience. And, they are a whole lot of fun!<br/><br/>

This quiz will introduce you to some of the instruments played by the artists who shaped the musical landscape with their guitars.</p><br/><br/>
